# Pyma-Challenge

## Analyzing pharmaceutical data with Python and Pandas

### Prepare the data: merge mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame, check for duplicate mice IDs, and remove duplicates to create a cleaned DataFrame.

### Generate summary statistics: create a DataFrame of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

### Create bar and pie charts: display the total time points for each drug regimen and the distribution of male vs. female mice.

### Calculate quartiles and outliers, create a box plot: find final tumor volume for each mouse for four treatments, determine outliers, and plot distribution.

### Create line plot and scatter plot: plot tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin and plot tumor volume vs. mouse weight for Capomulin treatment.

### Calculate correlation and regression: calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin.

### Submit final analysis.
